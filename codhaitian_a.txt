   <h1> BubbleUnder.com </h1>

   <p> Diving club for <em> Haitians </em>, let’s make a splash! </p>

   
     
   <p> Glad you could drop in and share some air with us! You’ve       
       passed your underwater navigation skills and successfully       
       found your way to the start point – or in this case, our       
       home page. </p> 

   <h2> About Us </h2> 

   <p>  <span style = "color: blue; "> Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in Haiti who meet up for diving trips in the summer 
months when the weather is good and the beach waves are 
flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the 
costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone 
gets a trustworthy dive buddy. </span> </p> 

 <div id ="paragraph">
   <p> Although we’re based in Haiti, we don’t stay on our 
own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to 
Scapa Flow in Senegal and to Madagascar’s numerous wreck 
sites. </p> 
</div>
            <!--end of paragraph-->

   <p> When we’re not diving, we often meet up in a local pub 
to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, hope not?).</p> 

   

<p> HELLO WALLAC </p>

<p style = "color: green; font-weight: bold;"> I am the hulk and a lion. </p>
